# Variants of U-Boot
with changes from different vendors

This project is an attempt to create a tree of changes made to the original U-Boot
sources by different vendors. Device-specific U-Boot sources are harvested from SDK
and from officially provided sources. Derivatives reside in their own branches making
it easy to track changes between branches.

Tree of branches:
- __2013.07__ (from https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot/releases/tag/v2013.07)
  - __isvp-sdk-t10-20-3.9.0__ (from ISVP-SDK-T10-20 v3.9.0)
